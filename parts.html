<section>Parts of a Computer
                                   <section>
<h2>Two Sides</h2>
A Computer is composed of two types of component:
<ul>
<li>Hardware: physical parts of the computer</li>
<li>Software: programs which do work on the hardware</li>
</ul>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<section>
<h2>Hardware</h2>
<p>What parts of a computer do you think are hardware?
</section>
<section>
<h2>Hardware</h2>
<p>
These are the main components of a standard computer:
<ul>
<li>Processor</li>
<li>RAM: Random Access Memory</li>
<li>Storage (Hard Disk)</li>
<li>Graphics</li>
<li>Network Interface</li>
<li>Removable Storage</li>
</ul>
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Peripherals</h2>
<p>
To use the computer you will often use the following peripherals:
<ul>
<li>Monitor</li>
<li>Keyboard</li>
<li>Mouse</li>
</ul>
</p>
</section>
 <section>
<h2>Processor</h2>
 <img data-src="images/486.jpg" style="background:none; border:none; box-shadow:none; float: left;"  alt="CPU 486" height="20%" width="20%">
<img data-src="images/486back.jpg" style="background:none; border:none; box-shadow:none; float: right;"  alt="CPU 486" height="20%" width="20%">
<p>The Processor is the critical component; without it the computer will not function.
<p>Commonly referred to as a Central Processing Unit (CPU).
<p>Performs the calculations and operations which allow a computer to process data - this allows the computer to support the user.
</section>
<section>
<h2>Processor</h2>
    <img data-src="images/cpu-diagram.gif" style="background:none; border:none; box-shadow:none;"  alt="CPU Diagram" height="110%" width="110%">
</section>
<section>
<h2>Processor</h2>
<p>
A Processor can be complex but these are the key units:
<ul>
<li>Control Unit: Manages the operations in the CPU - data transfer, instruction direction.</li>
<li>Arithmetic Logic Unit: Does the basic arithmetic, comparison and logic operations. </li>
<li>Memory Management Unit: Manages how the CPU talks to working memory.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p> Modern Processors are often multi-core - meaning more one processor on the same hardware.
</section>
<section>
<h2>Memory</h2>
<p>Computers need to store data to work on.
<p>A computer has different types of memory and storage devices which are used to do this.
<p>These technologies allow a computer to work with a memory hierarchy to manage its short and long term needs.
</section>
<section>
<img data-src="images/memory.png" alt="Memory Pyramid" height="80%" width="80%" style="background:none; border:none; box-shadow:none;" >
</section>
<section>
<h2>Registers and Cache</h2>
<p>Registers are memory locations in the Processor which hold a value being worked or about to be worked on, these are very fast but are expensive and have a specific purpose in the processor.
<p>Cache is a special fast type of memory which is part of the processor but acts as a location where results and new data can be accessed very quickly during a programs operation.
<p>Cache is not as fast as registers. 
<p>Cache holds much more data than registers.
</section>
<section>
<h2>Memory</h2>
<p>The next level is often termed RAM - Random Access Memory.
<p>This is similar to Cache but is not as fast, it is seperate from the Processor making access slower.
<p>This memory will hold the working set of data for the running programs in the computer.
<p>This memory is fast - not as fast as a processor or cache but much faster than a hard disk drive or DVD.
</section>
<section>
<p>In modern computers, it is measured in Gigabytes.
<p>Important thing to note about this memory (and cache/registers) is that once you remove power, all the data is lost.
<p>A lot of modern memory comes in the form of DIMMs (Dual In-line Memory Modules)
<p>

</section>
<section>
<h2>Storage</h2>
<p>Storage is where you keep your data and programs when the power is turned off.
<p>Although RAM is fast, it loses its contents when it has no power - this is where different types of storage come in.
<p>The primary form of storage in a modern computer is the hard disk or solid state drive.
</section>
<section>
<h2>Storage</h2>
<img data-src="images/diskplatter.jpg" alt="Memory Module" height="30%" width="30%" style="background:none; border:none; box-shadow:none; float: right" >
<p>Hard disks store data magnetically - they are made up of "platters" which are disks coated in magnetic materials which can be altered to store data.
<p>Hard disks can store a lot of data but are slower than memory.
<p>Hard disks rotate the platters very quickly (7200RPM) and have specially designed read/write heads which can move across the disks. 

</section>
<section>
<h2>Storage</h2>
<img data-src="images/ssd.jpg" alt="Memory Module" height="30%" width="30%" style="background:none; border:none; box-shadow:none; float: right" >
<p>Solid State Drives are a newer technology with no moving parts - this means that mechanical failure doesn't occur - though electronic failure still can.
<p>SSDs are based around what is called flash non-volatile memory.
<p>It is a little like RAM but is a little slower and doesn't lose its data when the power goes away. It is related to the memory cards in a lot of modern phones and cameras.
</section>
<section>
<h2>Removable Storage</h2>
<p> Storage which can be moved from system to system without disassembly
                <ul>
                        <li>USB Flash Drive - Storage devices using Flash memory similar to SSD.</li>
                        <li>Flash Memory Cards - Similar to SSD and Flash Drive but lack the integrated read/write components</li>
                        <li>Optical Storage - DVD, CD, Blu-Ray - Media which is read and written by use of a laser.</li>
                        <li>Tape Drives - Magnetic Tape Drives used for large scale storage - mainly in archiving operations</li>
                </ul>

</section>
<section>
<h2>Other Hardware</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Graphics Interface - How the data in the computer gets translated into a format that a monitor can understand.</li>
        <li>Network Interface - Hardware which allows a computer to contact a network and other devices - can be wired or wireless.</li>
</ul>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<section>
<h2>Software</h2>
<p>Software is what allows us to use the hardware of a computer.
<p>Software is a set of encoded instructions which allows the computer to operate and perform tasks.
<p>Some of these tasks are automatic to keep the system running and others are what the user wants to do.

<li>This acts as an interface between the hardware, applications and users.</li>
<li>
System software can be broken down into three main groups:
<ul>
<span class="fragment"><li><b>Operating System</b> - the essential control programs which manages the computer</li>

<span class="fragment"><li><b>Rootkit</b> - A piece of software which can help hide malicious software from a system.</li></span>
</ul>
</section>
</section>
