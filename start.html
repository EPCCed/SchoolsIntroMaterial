   <section>
      <h2>Why?</h2>
      <p>There are a set of steps to follow for making a cup of tea.
      <p>A recipe - in computing, science and maths recipe isn't the word used.
      <p>The term algorithm is used.
   </section>
<section>
      <h2>Algorithm</h2>
      <p>An alogrithm is a set of steps to follow to accomplish a task.
      <p>These form the basis of a program for a computer.
      <p>Often written in pseudo-code.
   </section>
   <section>
      <h2>Reading an Algorithm</h2>
      <p>Look at the instructions of another person.
      <p>How similar are the sets of instructions?
      <p>Can you understand them?

      <p><b>Important</b> - there can be multiple approaches to a problem.

  <span class="fragment"><p>On the worksheets there is a straight line corridor to move your person down.</p></span>
  <span class="fragment"><p>Write down a set of instructions to move your person down the corridor.</p></span>
  <span class="fragment"><p>Note that the pit is bottomless and if the person lands on it they fall forever.</p></span>

  <h2>Pseudo-Code</h2>
  <p>The steps of a program are written in a more accessible language (like English).</p>
  <p>It is used to detail how a program or part of a program should operate.</p>
  <p>Often used in design and preparation.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
  <h2>Pseudo-Code</h2>
  <p>There is no standard for pseudo-code.</p>
  <p>It may not replicate all aspects of actual code.</p>
  <p>It is for people not computers.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
  <h2>A Quote</h2>
  <p><i>"Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand."</i></p>
  <p>Attributed to Martin Fowler - a respected British software engineer.</p>
  <p>Write programs so that other people can understand them.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
   <h2>Actions</h2>
   <p>To make the navigation easier - lets create a set of standard steps called actions.</p>
   <p>What actions should we have?</p>
  </section>
<section>
   <h2>Actions</h2>
   <p>Some sample actions</p>
   <ul>
     <li>Walk 1 Space</li>
     <li>Run 2 Spaces</li>
     <li>Jump Over 1 Space</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Rewrite your instructions using these actions.</p>
 </section>
</section>
<section>
 <section>
  <h2>A Working Set?</h2>
  <p>You now have a working set of instructions.</p>
  <p>Will they always work?</p>
  <p>What happens if the position of the pit changes?</p>
 </section>
<section>
  <h2>Changing Circumstances</h2>
  <p>Up to now your person follows your instructions.</p>
  <p>You have complete knowledge of what will happen and the layout of the corridor.</p>
  <p>This rarely happens.</p>
  <p>We often have to make choices.</p>
</section>
  <section>
  <h2>Choices</h2>
     <img data-src="images/choice.png" alt="Path Image" height="50%" width="50%" style="background:none; border:none; box-shadow:none; ">

  </section>
  <section>
  <h2>Choices</h2>
  <p>The simplest choice can be written as:</p>
  <p><b>IF</b> condition <b>THEN</b> do this <b> ELSE </b> do this other thing</p> 
  <p>Examples:</p>
  <p><b>IF</b> it is raining <b>THEN</b> put up umbrella </p>
  <p><b>IF</b> cup of tea is too hot <b>THEN</b> let it cool <b>ELSE</b> drink the tea </p>
  </section>
  <section>
  <h2>Choices and Knowledge</h2>
  <p>To make a choice we need to evaluate something we can observe or know about.</p>
  <p>What could we add as actions to the person for our instructions?</p>
  </section>
  <section>
   <h2>New Actions</h2>
   <ul>
     <li>Look Ahead 1 Space - Gives information (Is there a pit or solid ground?)</li>
     <li>Determine Next Action (IF THEN)</li>
   </ul>
   <p>Rewrite your instructions using these actions.</p>
   <p>Try making up new corridors with different pit locations.</p>
 </section>
</section>
<section>
 <section>
  <h2>Different Lengths</h2>
  <p>What happens if the length of the corridor changes?</p>
 </section>
 <section>
  <h2>Continuation</h2>
  <p>Sometimes we have to keep going until a problem is done.</p>
  <p>Maybe we don't know the length of the problem or it may change.</p>
  <p>So we have to repeat actions.</p>
 </section>
 <section>
    <h2>Loops</h2>
        <img data-src="images/doloop.png" alt="Path Image" height="30%" width="30%" style="background:none; border:none; box-shadow:none; ">
 </section>
 <section>
    <h2>Loops</h2>
    <p>Loops allow us to repeat a set of actions until we reach a goal.</p>
    <p>This means we can check a condition like a choice.</p>
    <p>There are different types of loop.</p>
 </section>
 <section>
    <h2>Loops - Pseudo-Code</h2>
    <p>Writing a loop in pseudo-code:</p>
     <ul>
      <li>WHILE condition is met:</li>
      <ul>
         <li>Actions</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>WHILE kettle is not boiled:</li>
      <ul>
         <li>Wait and Twiddle Thumbs for 5 seconds</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
 </section>
 <section>
    <h2>Adding Loops In</h2>
    <p>We could surround other actions with the loop making it the "main" entry to the steps.</p>
    <p>So we could make this an action - Find Exit.
    <p>Try adding a loop to your instructions - and try changing the length of the corridor</p>
 </section>
</section>
<section>
<section>
<h2>Conditions</h2>
<p>A couple of bits have used the term condition.</p>
<p>A condition in this case is an expression which can be true or false.</p>
<p>We can say that these conditions are Boolean.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Conditions</h2>
<p>Boolean means that it can be used to describe values and operations which evaluate to true (1) or false (0).</p>
<p>Conditions can be simple or compound.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Simple</h2>
        <img data-src="images/tiamat.jpg" alt="Path Image" height="40%" width="40%" style="background:none; border:none; box-shadow:none; float: right; ">
<p>A simple condition is one which is either true or false and requires no other information.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>it is raining</i></li>
<li><i>the dragon has 5 heads</i></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Compound</h2>
<p>Sometimes it isn't as easy as one thing to check or maybe it has to be one thing and not another.</p>
<p>For this we have operators which are used to form compound conditions.</p>
<p>A fancy way of saying we will check more than one thing.</p>
<p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Operators</h2>
<p>To make compound expressions we use operators in different combinations.</p>
<p>These operators can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>AND</li>
<li>OR</li>
<li>NOT</li>
</ul>
<p>So we can do CONDITION1 AND CONDITION2 as a compound condition.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>AND Examples</h2>
<p>AND - both conditions need to be true for the AND operation to be true.</p>
<ul>
<li>Today is Wednesday AND Today is a school day - True</li>
<li>Dinosaurs are extinct AND A Dinosaur walked down the road today - False</li>
<li>The moon is made of cheese AND The sun is made of oranges - False</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h2>OR Examples</h2>
<p>OR - Either condition needs to be true for the OR operation to be true.</p>
<ul>
<li>Today is Wednesday OR Today is a school day - True</li>
<li>Dinosaurs are extinct OR A Dinosaur walked down the road today - True</li>
<li>The moon is made of cheese OR The sun is made of oranges - False</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h2>NOT Examples</h2>
<p>NOT - The condition is reversed - if it is False it becomes True </p>
<ul>
<li>NOT (Today is a school day) - False</li>
<li>NOT (A Dinosaur walked down the road today) - True</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Conditions</h2>
<p>Anything which can be evaluated to true or false can be part of a condition.</p>
<p>What conditions may be useful to have in our corridor instructions?</p>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<section>
<h2>A More Complicated Version</h2>
<p>So far, we have looked at straight lines, lets put in some corners.</p>
<p>The second corridor has two corners in it.</p>
<p>Can you write a set of instructions using the actions for this one?</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>A More Complicated Version</h2>
<p>What new actions will we need?</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>New Actions</h2>
<p>We will need to add or update actions:</p>
<ul>
     <li>Look Ahead 1 Space - Gives information (Add new response - wall)</li>
     <li>Determine Next Action (what happens if there is a wall?)</li>
     <li>Turn Left 90</li>
     <li>Turn Right 90</li>
   </ul>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Can you follow each others instructions?</h2>
<p>Try using each others instructions to move through the corridor.</p>
<p>Then try making a new corridor and see if it still works.</p>
<p>Should we add in anything else?</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Which Way?</h2>
<p>Look at the corridor in Sheet Number 3</p>
<p>This corridor has a T-junction in it.</p>
<p>This means the person could go left or right.</p>
<p>What happens if you write your instructions now?</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Dead Ends</h2>
<p>We can write a set of instructions that will cope with this layout but will it always deal with dead ends?</p>
<p>Are our instructions becoming more and more complicated?</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Dead Ends</h2>
<p>Maybe we need to consider moving backwards? Or should we turn?</p>
<p>Try out using a backwards move and decide which way would be better?</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Refining Actions</h2>
<p>Maybe we should change some actions to be better or more useful?</p>
<p>Current Actions:</p>
<ul>
     <li>Walk 1 Space</li>
     <li>Run 2 Spaces</li>
     <li>Jump Over 1 Space</li>
     <li>Look Ahead 1 Space - Gives information (slab,pit,wall)</li>
     <li>Determine Next Action (IF response THEN action)</li>
     <li>Turn Left 90</li>
     <li>Turn Right 90</li>
     <li>Loop (keep going till out)</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Refining Actions</h2>
<p>What to look for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Similar actions, different sizes</li>
  <li>Similar actions, different direction</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Refining Actions</h2>
<p>Some ideas for change</p>
<ul>
  <li>Move <i>N</i> Spaces in <i>Direction</i></li>
  <li>Turn <i>N</i> Degrees</li>
  <li>Turn <i>Direction</i></li>
  <li>Look <i>Direction</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Would need to define Direction to have options:<b>Ahead, Left, Right, Back</b>.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Refining Actions</h2>
<p>Choose a corridor and write instructions using our updated actions.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<section>
<h2>A Maze</h2>
<p>
Lets look at a Maze
</p>
<img data-src="images/mazeimage.png" alt="Maze Image" height="50%" width="50%" style="background:none; border:none; box-shadow:none;">
</section>
<section>
<h2>Your Maze</h2>
<p>
On the worksheet is a maze.
</p>
<p>
Double lines are walls, Pits are marked 'Pit' and the aim is to get from Start to Finish.
</p>
<p>
Try writing out your instructions.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Other mazes</h2>
<p>
How would you instructions work in another maze?
</p>
<p>What did you assume in your instructions? - did you assume anything?</p>
<p>What new problems could occur?</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Any Problems?</h2>
<p>How do you remember which way you have been before?</p>
<p>How can you solve this?</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>An idea</h2>
<p>How do we do this in the real world when searching for things?</p>
<p>Do we search where we have already searched?</p>
<p>What do we do?</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Memory and Actions</h2>
<p>When we do things, we remember what we did.</p>
<p>How do we do this?</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Memory and Actions</h2>
<span class="fragment">
<p>We have our own memories - but how much can we remember at any one time?</p>
</span>
<span class="fragment">       
<p>We can take notes - provided we have something to take notes on.</p>
</span>
<span class="fragment">       
<p>We can change our world to help us remember - if we search in a house - maybe we close all the doors of the rooms we searched already.</p>
</span>
</section>
<section>
<h2>A little aside</h2>
<p>Can we always trust what we see and remember?</p>
<p> We will try two little experiments - one on what we see and one on what we remember.</p>
</section>

<h2>Watch the video</h2>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ubNF9QNEQLA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Perception</h2>
<p>Sometimes we have to account for what we see not matching what we understand or what is really there.</p>
<p>So sometimes we have to have aids to help us.</p>
</section>
<!-- http://psych.wustl.edu/memory/Roddy%20article%20PDF's/Stadler%20et%20al%20(1999)_MemCog.pdf -->
<section>
<h2>Memory</h2>
<p>Listen to the list of words which are going to be read out.</p>
<p>Do not write anything down.</p>
<span class="fragment"><p>Now write down all the words you can remember.</p>
<span class="fragment"><p>How well did you do?</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Memory</h2>
<p>On average we only remember in our immediate recall 7 items plus or minus 2.</p>
<p>People use association to remember things. This can cause problems.</p>
<p>Computers are a little different but how could we take the aids we have and use them in our maze person?</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>New Actions</h2>
<p>Let us use a method like closing the doors after searching a room - we will mark the maze as we make choices. This means that if we have to go back we don't make the same choice.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mark Choice - put an 'X' on the choice we made at an intersection</li>
<li>Check Choice Markers - check to see if any of the intersection paths have already been used.</li>
<li>Count Steps - Maybe each time we make a choice we want to record how many steps we took - is this useful?</li>
<li>Write/Read Steps - when we hit an intersection we mark down or read the steps to it from the previous point - could this be useful?</li> 
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h2>How do you write it now?</h2>
<p>Try writing a new set of instructions.</p>
<p>You should notice that each time we make the problem harder the instructions change but with a bit of thought we can make them more flexible.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section>
<section>
<h2>How about a Dragon chasing you?</h2>
<p>Let's make it a little more interesting - a dragon is in the maze trying to hunt you down.</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Writing the dragon</h2>
<p>What should our dragon do?</p>
<ul>
<span class="fragment">Track down your person</span>
<span class="fragment">Breathe Fire</span>
<span class="fragment">Eat Person</span>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Dragon Actions</h2>
<p>How do we turn these into a set of actions?</p>
<p>We can reuse a lot of the prior actions we used for our person.</p>
<p>What about new actions?</p>
</section>
<section>
<p>Tracking - maybe a Sniff action: sniff - which says which direction (up/down/left/right) the person is</p>
<p>Fire - an action to breathe fire over some squares - firebreath - which puts out fire for 2 squares in front</p>
<p>Eat Person - an action to eat a person right in front of it - eat</p>
So using these actions and what you have already try writing a dragon.
</section>
<section>
<h2>Trying this out</h2>
Now to test our running person and our dragon - in pairs, one of you act as the person, the other as the dragon and see who gets out and who gets eaten.
</section>
 <section>
  <h2>Problems</h2>
  <p>There maybe a few problems - did you move at the same time, was one faster than the other or maybe something else?</p>
  <p>So we need to have some way of making things work together and not get out of step.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
   <h2>Timing</h2>
   <p>Lets think about time, when we play a board game or a computer game there are turns or there is some form of clock. These say what we can do when and how much we can do.</p>
   <p>So lets add a clock to our little dungeon</p>
   <p>For each "tick" of the clock, the running person and the dragon can each perform an action.</p>
   <p>This means that each of our players has to do the next action in their instructions on each clock tick.</p>
 </section>
 <section>
   <p>An action is each time we have something to do so an choice may take several clock ticks to get the person or dragon to do something.</p>
   <p>For this exercise, everyone will perform an action on a clock tick. This is not always the case - maybe an action takes two clock ticks or maybe something blocks an action and you have to wait.</p>
 </section>
 <section>
   <p>But this doesn't solve all our problems - what happens if we try to do actions which conflict with each over.</p>
   <p>In computers this can cause problems without a way to resolve this - in our dungeon, the way to resolve this is that if a conflict occurs the action of the person gets done before the action of the dragon.</p>
   <p>This is because the dragon is huge and the person is small and can change quicker.</p>
 </section>
<section>
<h2>New Runner Actions</h2>
<p>Should we add new actions to the runner?</p>
<p>What could these be?</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Do a Chase</h2>
<p>Try out comparing how each others dragons and people behave when facing each other.</p>
