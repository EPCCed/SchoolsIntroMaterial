<section>Binary Numbers
<section><h2>Here there be Dragons</h2>
<p>A land of wizards and soldiers ruled by a central city has four villages at its compass points. The land exists in the valley of dragons. 
Every so often the dragons will attempt to raid the villages. To combat this the wizards can transport soldiers but they need to know how many soldiers to send.
<p>Each village has three signal fires and the wizards are trying to work out how to get the fires to signal more that three dragons are approaching.
</section>
<section>
 <img data-src="images/village.png" alt="Creative Commons License Image" style="background:none; border:none; box-shadow:none; " height="70%" width="70%"/>
<p>Do you have an idea?
</section>
<section><h2>Lets Try Binary</h2>
<p> If we use binary, we can indicate up to seven dragons approaching.
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>0</td><td>000</td><td>4</td><td>100</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>1</td><td>001</td><td>5</td><td>101</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>2</td><td>010</td><td>6</td><td>110</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>3</td><td>011</td><td>7</td><td>111</td>

  </tr>
</table>
</section>
<section><h2>A Different Base</h2>
<p>We normally count in base 10. This means each column in a number is a power of 10.
<p>The number 125 breaks down like this:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Hundreds <script type="math/tex; mode=display">(10^2)</script></td><td>Tens<script type="math/tex; mode=display">(10^1)</script></td><td>Units<script type="math/tex; mode=display">(10^0)</script></td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td align="center">1</td><td align="center">2</td><td align="center">5</td>
</tr>
</table>
</section>
<section><h2>A Different Base</h2>
<p>Numbers in computers are stored and represented in binary. This uses base 2.
This means each column in a number is a power of 2.
<p>The number 12 is written as 1100 and breaks down like this:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Eights <script type="math/tex; mode=display">(2^3)</script></td><td>Fours<script type="math/tex; mode=display">(2^2)</script></td><td>Twos<script type="math/tex; mode=display">(2^1)</script></td> <td>Units <script type="math/tex; mode=display">(2^0)</script></td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td align="center">1</td><td align="center">1</td><td align="center">0</td><td align="center">0</td>
</tr>
</table>
</section>
<section><h2>Examples</h2>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>65</td><td>1000001</td><td>32</td><td>100000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>9</td><td>1001</td><td>14</td><td>1110</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Now you choose a number and try to write it in binary.
<p>For numbers like this the maximum value is <script type="math/tex; mode=display">(2^n)-1</script> where n is the number of bits.
</section>
<section><h2>Negative Numbers</h2>
<p>We have to deal with negative numbers.
<p>We don't have a negative sign in the same way we do when writing a number done normally.
<p>One way we could do it is to make the first bit 1 for negative numbers and 0 for positive numbers.
<p>This has problems - we get two zeros and it reduces the range of numbers we can represent.
</section>
<section><h2>Negative Numbers</h2>
<p>We use what is called two's complement.
<p>This is a method for representing postive and negative numbers but has no issue with the zero.
<p>We do need to know the number of bits in a number representation. So for four bits we can do the following:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>4</td><td>0100</td><td>0</td><td>0000</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>-4</td><td>1100</td><td>-1</td><td>1111</td>
</tr>
</table>
</section>
<section><h2>Two's Complement</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Choose a number</li>
  <li>Convert the number to binary ignoring the sign. So 5 = 0101.
  <li>Postive numbers, finish here.
  <li>Negative numbers - change all the 1s to 0 and the 0s to 1 (this is the complement)
  <li>Add one to the complement.
</ul>
<p>This introduces a range that can be represented by n bits.
<p>Lowest value is <script type="math/tex; mode=display">-(2^{(n-1)})</script> and Highest value is <script type="math/tex; mode=display">+(2^{(n-1)})-1</script>
</section>
</section>
<section>Storing Data
<section><h2>How do letters fit in?</h2>
Now numbers can be represented in binary - how do we represent letters?</section>
<section><h2>Using Numbers to represent numbers</h2>
<p>We can use numbers to represent letters and other symbols in text.
<p>There are many ways to do this - we will look at a standard called 7-bit ASCII.
<p>This was one of the first main encodings for text.
<p>There are 128 entries in 7-bit ASCII - these are used for characters, spaces and symbols.
</section>
<section><h2>A Text Example</h2>
<table>
<tr>
<td>Words</td><td>1010111 1101111 1110010 1100100 1110011</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>in</td><td>1101001 1101110</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>ASCII</td><td>1000001 1010011 1000011 1001001 1001001</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>code</td><td>1100011 1101111 1100100 1100101</td>
</tr>
</table> 
<p>Write the ASCII for this word: Dragon
</section>
<section><h2>Common File Formats</h2>
<ul>
<li>HTML - Webpages which are text in ASCII or Unicode.</li>
<li>Comma Seperated Values - textual data seperated by commas.</li>
<li>PDF - A document format.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section><h2>Images: How can we use binary here?</h2>
<p>How can we use binary to represent images?
<p>There are a lot of ways.
<p>Images are made up of pixels in a computer - each pixel needs to have a colour assigned to it.
<p>Images are an X by Y grid of pixels at the basic level.
</section>
<section><h2>Colours</h2>
<p>A colour palette - a set of colours with an identifying number which can be each pixel in an image.
<p>Colour Encoding - each pixel is encoded with a colour scheme such as RGB or CMYK 
</section>
<section><h2>Bitmaps</h2>
<p>One of the most basic image formats is the bitmap.
<p>In a bitmap each pixel is represent by a bit pattern which represents a colour.
<p>Bitmaps are generally 8, 16, 24 or 32bit.
<p>Each pixel is represented by a number of bits - so in an 8bit bitmap each pixel has 8bits to determine its colour. 
</section>
<section>
<img data-src="images/bitmap.png" alt="Creative Commons License Image" style="background:none; border:none; box-shadow:none; " height="60%" width="60%"/>
</section>
<section><h2>Bitmaps</h2>
<p>8 bits means that a pixel can have one of 256 colours - which likely be indexed in a encoding table.
<p>In a 24bit bitmap - each pixel has 3 8bit numbers - each of which define the Red Green and Blue components of the pixel.
<p>This means the pixel can be one of more the 16 million colours.
<p>These are generally stored as Blue, Green then Red.
